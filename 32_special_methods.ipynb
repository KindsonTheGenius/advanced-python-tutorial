    "**Object Initialization** \\\n",
    "__init__(self,...): Called when an object is instantiated\n",
    "__repr__(self): Defines the official string representation of an object\n",
    "__str__(self): Defines the user-friendly string representation\n",

    "**Arithmethic Operators** \\\n",
    "* __add__(self, other): Defines the behaviour of the + operator\n",
    "* __sub__(self, other): Defines the behaviour of the - operator\n",
    "* __mul__(self, other): Defines the behaviour of the * operator\n",
    "* other include __truediv__, __floordiv__ and __mod__\n",
