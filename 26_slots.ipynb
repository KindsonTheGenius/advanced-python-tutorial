    "## Slots\n",
    "Slots in Python (`__slot__`) are used to optimize memory usage and improve performance in classes by restricting the creation of instance attributes to a predefined set.\n",
    "This is particularly useful in scenarios where memory efficiency is critical, such as applications involving a large number of objects\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How Slots Work\n",
    "1. By default, Python classes use a  dictionary (`__dict__`) to store instance attributes. This allows attributes to be dynamically added or removed at runtime. Dictionaries however consume a significant amount of memory\n",
    "2. With `__slots__`, Python does not  have to create a `__dict__` for instances. Instead, a fixed more memory-efficient structure is used to store the attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Defining Slots\n",
    "Slots are defined as tuples, lists or iterable containing the names of the attributes.\n"

    "#### Advantages of Slots\n",
    "**1. Reduced Memory Usage** \\\n",
    "* Eliminates the need for a per-instane __dict__\n",
    "* Memory savings are significant in scenarios involving many objects\\\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Faster Attribute Access** \\\n",
    "* Attribute access is faster since attributes are stored in a fixed structure \\\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Prevents Dynamic Attribute Addition** \\\n",
    "* Disallows adding attributes not listed in __slots__ making the class more predictable \\\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations of Slots\n",
    "* Instances cannot have dynamic attributes unless a __dict__ entry is explicitly added\n",
    "* Slots with multiple inheritance may lead to conflicts"
